DigiLib
=======

This is common part of all android-digiNNN software. If you are developing an application and want to include the shared code or resources from a library project, you can do so easily by adding a reference to this one.
A small example about using library in [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/) environment located at [http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/projects/projects-eclipse.html] (http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/projects/projects-eclipse.html)

Of course you may use it with your preferred environment like [Netbeans](http://netbeans.org/), [Idea](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), [Ensime](https://github.com/aemoncannon/ensime) or whatever you like.

Feel free to translate or modify documentation, edit wiki or add comments.

Having question, suggestion or idea about the software? Contact us or open issue.
